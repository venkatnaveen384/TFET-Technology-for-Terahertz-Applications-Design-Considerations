# TFET-Technology-for-Terahertz-Applications-Design-Considerations


This research paper explores the impact of a novel approach to drain doping engineering on the behavior of Tunneling Field-Effect Transistors (TFETs) through TCAD simulations. The central concept involves the construction of a TFET structure that utilizes dual doping levels in the drain region: a high-doped region situated above a low-doped one. Our investigation indicates a significant alteration in the tunneling phenomenon at the interface between the channel and drain due to this dual drain doping configuration. Specifically, the introduction of two distinct drain regions leads to an expansion in the tunneling width at the channel-drain junction. This expansion plays a key role in significantly reducing ambipolar current in the TFET, an essential aspect for improved device performance.
